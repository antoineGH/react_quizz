## 1. Project description<a name="description"></a>

In this project I build a quiz app with complex state objects different state hooks and render things based on state.

## 2. Technologies<a name="tech"></a>

This system is provisioned to be built in JavaScript using React library which is highly flexible.

The browser will be in charge of rendering this application in its final form, HTML. Some of the logic involved in creating the web page, especially the one in charge of dealing with presentation logic is handled on the client-side.
